# CAPS
Centralised Announcement Platform for Students

This is the admin/server side of the application. It is meant to run on windows devices.
It is meant for management purposes and to contain all the data added to the application. This data is then fetched and displayed by a separate android application (User application).

The intended purpose of the application is to keep students notified and aware of the school academic calendar, news and updates and the school notice board without having to physically seek this information.
It is a great tool for management to communicate with it's students and avoid last minute anxitey.
